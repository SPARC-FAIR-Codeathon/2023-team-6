Create the code for two files: (1) a Python script to load and run machine learning regression modeling on a dataset from a CSV file; and (2) a Dockerfile to create a Docker image to contain the necessary Python packages for the analysis. Copy the Python script into the image so that the script will run automatically when the container is created. Name the Python script "script.py". Name the anaysis results file "results.txt". In the Dockerfile, do not include a maintainer label and install the Python packages and do not use a "requirements.txt" file. Make section headers in the output: "script.py" and "Dockerfile". Do not include the words python, Python, dockerfile, or Dockerfile in the response for each code block. If this is needed for the Dockerfile, the current package install name for sci-kit learn is "scikit-learn". A sample of the first 3 rows from "regression_dataset.csv" are below. Make sure that that the python script running inside the container has access to the data file by mounting the host data directory in docker run to the "/app" directory inside the container, which will also be where the results.txt will be saved. Do not use the Dockerfile COPY command to copy the dataset.
